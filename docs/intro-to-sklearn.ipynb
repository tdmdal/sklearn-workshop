    "## Machine Learning in Sklearn Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is about creating model from data. In most circumstances our data is in a basic table format. Sklearn accepts such two-dimensional data in which each row represents individual elements of the data and the columns represent properties related to those elements. This table layout is also referred to as __Feature Matrix__. Feature matrix is most often contained in a NumPy `ndarray` or a Pandas `DataFrame` and will have a shape of `[n_samples, n_featuers]`, which refers to the number of rows and the number of columns respectively. Feature matrix is often stored as `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the feature matrix `X`, there can also be a __label__ or __target array__, conventionally stored as `y`. The target array is the quantity we want to predict from the data. Thus, the target array is present in a __supervised learning implementation__. The target array is usually a one-dimensional object, has the same length as `n_samples` and is often contained in a NumPy `ndarray` or a Pandas `Series`. The target value may be continuous numerical values or discrete classes/categories. When the target is continous value it is a __regression problem__ and when the target is discrete value, it is a __classification problem__.\n",

    "In the residual plot above, each point is a single market, where the prediction made by the model is on the x-axis and the accuracy of the prediction is on the y-axis. The distance from the line at 0 is how bad the prediction was for that value. So 0 means the prediction was exact, positive value means prediction was too low and negative value means prediction was too high. \n",

    "We note that the residual plot exhibit some pattern. This suggests that the model has room for improvement. Many factors can contribute to the inaccuracy of the model. Having more data can help get best possible prediction. Perhaps the relationship between predictor variables and target is not linear and/or they do not have high enough correlation to predict the target value accurately. \n",

    "We can try omitting one of the variables and train a linear regression model again to see if that can help account for some of these inaccuracies. "
